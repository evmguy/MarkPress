## How to contribute

If you haven't already, come find us in the [Modularr Chat]. We want you working on things you're excited about.

Here are some important resources:

  * Contributions? [Contribution Guidelines](https://github.com/Modularr/Contributions) tells you how to contribute
  * Bugs? [Issues](https://github.com/Modularr/YAML-FrontMatter/issues) is where to report them
  * Chat? [Modularr Chat] on Discord. We're usually there during business hours.

#### **Did you find a bug?**

* **Ensure the bug was not already reported** by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/Modularr/YAML-FrontMatter/issues).

* If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one]. Be sure to include a **title and clear description**, as much relevant information as possible, and a **code sample** or an **executable test case** demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.

#### **Did you write a patch that fixes a bug?**

* Open a new GitHub pull request with the patch.

* Ensure the PR description clearly describes the problem and solution. Include the relevant issue number if applicable.

* Before submitting, please read the [Contributing to Modularr] guide to know more about coding conventions and benchmarks.

#### **Do you intend to add a new feature or change an existing one?**

* Suggest your change in the [Modularr Chat] and start writing code.

* Do not open an issue on GitHub until you have collected positive feedback about the change. GitHub issues are primarily intended for bug reports and fixes.

#### **Do you have questions about the source code?**

* Ask any question about how to use **Yaml-FrontMatter** in the [Modularr Chat].

#### Coding conventions

Start reading our code and you'll get the hang of it.
- We indent using four spaces
- We avoid unnecessary code following the [KISS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle) approach.
  - We focus on minimalism and simplicity in code.
- We avoid unnecessary code following the [YAGNI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/You_aren%27t_gonna_need_it) approach.
  - A good example of this is not using **Namespaces for the sake of using namespaces**.

Modularr Packages are a volunteer effort. We encourage you to pitch in and **join the team**!

Thanks!
